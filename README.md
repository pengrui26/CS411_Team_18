## Project Overview
Github + is a full-stack Spring Boot application designed to provide users with restaurant recommendations in their vicinity. Not only can users explore nearby restaurants and their popular dishes, but they can also receive restaurant recommendations tailored to their tastes. Moreover, for those traveling abroad, we've integrated DeepL APIs to translate restaurant menus into a user's preferred language. 

### Features
- **Search & Recommendations**: Easily search available restaurants nearby and get personalized recommendations based on user order history.
- **Language Translation**: Leverage DeepL APIs to translate restaurant details to users' preferred languages.
- **Real-time Github Resources**: Fetch real-time resources using Github API.
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Implements content-based recommendation algorithms by extracting order information from Github resources.
- **Data Storage**: Uses either MongoDB or MySQL for storing user-generated data, such as order histories, and Google Cloud Storage for storing multi-type files, like restaurant-related pictures.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated registration, login, and logout functionalities with Spring Security.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Engaging frontend design using React and Ant Design.
